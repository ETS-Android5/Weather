# The Weather

This was my very first Android app. The first and the last app I wrote in Java.

A simple weather app with primitive architecture but interesting and unique design idea.

The main feature is in its design - a funny character who changes his behaviour based on the weather/time of the year is the base of an application. It feels like this tail gnome just tells you everything about the weather. He also sends you notifications as you set it up in the settings.
